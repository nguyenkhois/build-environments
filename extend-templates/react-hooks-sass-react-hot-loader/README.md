# The advance React Hooks project template
The project template supports also HMR ([Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/)) for both JavaScript and SCSS.

## Main features
* HMR ([Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/)) is activated for __both__ JS and SCSS that's why the page is not refresh whenever you make a change in your code.
* Synchronised browser testing by using [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/).
* Directory `/dist` is deleted and then created automatic whenever you run the command `npm run build`.
* CSS (that is compiled automatic from SCSS) and JS files are injected automatic into the HTML template file `index.html`.
* Code splitting - Many JS entry points are supported and your code are compiled into the directory `/dist` with the three separate file extensions `*.html, *.css, *.js`.
* Image handling - Automatic copying the directory `/src/images` into `/dist` whenever you build your code or during the development.
* You can use `async`/ `await` for fetching data from API.
