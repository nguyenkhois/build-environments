## Work directory

Your application is within the `/src` directory:
* `images` directory is using to store all images are used in your application.
* `index.html` file is the main HTML template.
* `index.js` file is the main entry point for your application.

You don't need to care about the `/dist` directory (distribution directory). It is deleted and then created automatic during the application building when you run the command `npm run build`.
