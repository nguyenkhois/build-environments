## Work directory
````
/
|--/dist
|--/src
|    |--/images
|    |--index.html
|    |--index.js
|    |--...
|--package.json
|--...
````
Your application is within the `/src` directory:
* `images` directory is using to store all images are used in your application.
* `index.html` is the main HTML template.
* `index.js` is the main entry point for your code.

You don't need to care about the `/dist` directory (distribution/ publish). It is deleted and then created automatic during the application building when you run the command `npm start` or `npm run build`.
